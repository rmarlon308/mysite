    content: |-
      I am a data scientist pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at the Autonomous University of Madrid, currently working on my Master's thesis with a focus on artificial intelligence. I hold an engineering degree in Computer Science from San Francisco de Quito University. Throughout my career, I have developed and implemented numerous machine learning models that drive business value. My professional experience includes working at Banco Solidario S.A., where I led data analytics projects and developed interactive dashboards to enhance customer experience and sales efficiency.

      I have expertise in various artificial intelligence techniques and statistical analysis, I have worked with machine learning and deep learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, Biometrics and recommendation systems. I have earned several certifications from MITx MicroMasters in data analysis, statistics, and machine learning. My research, published in IEEE, highlights my contributions to machine learning and path planning optimization. Additionally, I am fluent in both Spanish and English.
